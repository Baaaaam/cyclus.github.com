Abstract
========

a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

Specification
=============

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new
feature.

Motivation
==========

The motivation is critical for CEPs that want to change the Cyclus ecosystem. It
should clearly explain why the existing language specification is inadequate to
address the problem that the CEP solves. CEP submissions without sufficient
motivation may be rejected outright.

Rationale
=========

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the
design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe
alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is
supported in other languages.

Backwards Compatability
=======================

All CEPs that introduce major backwards incompatibilities must include a section
describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The CEP must explain how
the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. CEP submissions
without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

Reference Implementation
========================

The reference implementation must be completed before any CEP is given status
“Final”, but it need not be completed before the CEP is accepted.
