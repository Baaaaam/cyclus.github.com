Abstract
========

Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new
feature.

Motivation
==========

Discussion of motivation vis-a-vis current market implementation.

Rationale

Discussion from prelim - why the phases, etc.

Backwards Compatability
=======================

All CEPs that introduce major backwards incompatibilities must include a section
describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The CEP must explain how
the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. CEP submissions
without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

Reference Implementation
========================

The reference implementation must be completed before any CEP is given status
“Final”, but it need not be completed before the CEP is accepted.
