Abstract
========
The purpose of this CEP is to clearly deliniate the purpose -- technical and 
cultural -- of the various projects which make up the *Cyclus* ecosystem.  
Projects, for purposes here, are unique entities which have independent lifetimes
and central concerns. Many projects may try to tackle the same concern but no 
single project may tackle more than one concern.  Concerns, like projects, may 
be dependent upon one another.

The central concerns in the *Cyclus* ecosystem are **system dynamics**, 
**domain models**, and **visulaization & analysis**.

Concerns
========

include optimizations
