Greetings! As the fall weather approaches the Cyclus development team wants to give you an update
on the work being done and updates one things currently in development. 

Developments
============
Geolocation
-----------
Cyclus modules now have the capability to utilize real values for latitude and
longitude. This allows developers and users to plot the facilities that Cyclus
builds at coordinates on mapping tools, such as google maps. This utility is also
useful for instituions or regions that might be interested in determining where
facilities should be placed using GIS information. 


Third Party Modules
===================
CyBorg
------
CyBorg has been given an offical release. <TODO: Information on CyBorg>

Bright-lite
-----------
Bright-lite has been updated to work with the new build system for cyclus. Bright-lite has also been
mitraged to the BriXsuite organization on github. Development on the module is still continuing
if you'd like to contribute to the software please contact Robert Flanagan at flanagrr@mailbox.sc.edu. 

CyCLASS
-------
A `cyclus module under development <https://github.com/CNERG/cyCLASS>`_ that leverages the work of the CLASS methodology. More
information on CLASS can be found `here <https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/sens/CLASS>`_ (registration required).  

Events
======

TWoFCS
------
July 19th through the 21st, the ERGS group at the University of South Carolina hosted a
Technical Workshop on Fuel Cycle Simulation. Several members of the Cyclus community
were in attendance and presented cyclus related work. Talks involving Cyclus included:

- CyCLASS
- CyBorg
- Rickshaw

Additionally, Dr. Yarden Livnat was present at the meeting to talk about visualization
and how it can be used to support simulation. Dr. Livnat supports Cyclus primarily
though a NEUP, but was available to get feedback from the attendees.  

Cyclus Developer Meeting
------------------------
Following the Technical Workshop on Fuel Cycle Simulation (TWoFCS), several members of the
cyclus development team met to discuss the current state, and future of Cyclus. Over the
course of the meeting a list of current use cases and issues were brought up to set a basis
for where future efforts should be focused. From this base, a list of improvements and
changes were built. 

- Publish a Python Notebook with demonstration of Cymetric usage
- Update the database to make the analysis of results easier to accomplish. 
- Split Cycamore - create a new repository for more advanced modules. 
- Add python notebook section to website.
- Create a database for real existing reactors
- Package in with cyclus a list of recipes common fuel forms
- Update cyclus tutorial
