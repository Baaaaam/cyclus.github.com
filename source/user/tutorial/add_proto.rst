Adding Prototypes to your Simulation
====================================

Configuring an Archetype to Create a Prototype
-----------------------------------------------

In order for a given archetype to have broad applicability, the developer will
probably identify a number of parameters that the user can use to define
specific details.  In the reactor example above, the developer will probably
allow the user to define the power level of the reactor, independent of the
specific model chosen to represent the behavior of the model.  Other common
reactor paramters are fuel loading parameters such as cycle length and batch
size.
