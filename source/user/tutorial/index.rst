|Cyclus| User Tutorial
======================

In this tutorial, we will build, run and analyze a fuel cycle scenario using
Cyclist, the graphical user interface developed specifically for the Cyclus
fuel cycle simulator.  This tutorial assumes that the learner is already
familiar with the purpose of a fuel cycle simulator. This tutorial will
require an internet connection so that |cyclus| can be run remotely.

Overview
---------

During this tutorial, we will create two separate fuel cycle scenarios:

1. A simple once-through scenario: The purpose of this exercise is to
   introduce the basic concepts of |Cyclus| and the layout of the user
   interface.

2. A MOX recycle scenario with growing energy demand: The purpose of this
   exercise is to demonstrate a more complete set of current capabilities.
